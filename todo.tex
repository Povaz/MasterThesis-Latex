TODO LIST
5. Change all introductions to Chapter/Sections by inserting the references to the actual Section rather than enumerating them verbally (like 'the first section..' --> 'Section 1.1...')
6. Re-read the Augmented Approach Section and change all the "augmented" into "extended"
7. Move 'Impact of Delays on Agent's performances' in Chapter 1 'Introduction'.




RESULTS SCHEMA
- AISTATS test shows that training the Modules on Stochastic Delays is too difficult. Solution is too train the module on a sufficiently high amount of delay.
- Deterministic Module (always output prediction state):
    - Trained on Deterministic Delays on Deterministic Environment (Det. Inverted Pendulum)
        - Tested on Deterministic Delays
        - Tested on Stochastic Delays
    - Trained on Deterministic Delays (5) on Stochastic Environment (Noise Inverted Pendulum)
        - Tested on Deterministic Delays
        - ?
- Stochastic Module (always output prediction belief):
    - Trained on Deterministic Delays (5) on Deterministic Environment (Det. Inverted Pendulum)
        - Tested on Deterministic Delays
        - Tested on Stochastic Delays
    - Trained on Deterministic Delays (5) on Stochastic Environment (Noise Inverted Pendulum)
        - Tested on Deterministic Delays
        - ?
